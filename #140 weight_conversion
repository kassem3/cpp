/*
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win
championship belts for various weight categories on other planets
within the solar system.

Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his
target weight by:

- It should ask him what his earth weight is.
- Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
- It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.
# 	Planet	 Relative Gravity
1 	Mercury	 0.38

3 	Mars	 0.38
4 	Jupiter	 2.34
5 	Saturn	 1.06
6 	Uranus	 0.92
7 	Neptune  1.19
